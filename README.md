# C++ Algorithms

This repository is a curated collection of algorithmic solutions written in **C++**, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and practical usage. Each commit in this repository corresponds to the implementation of a single algorithm or problem-solving technique. This approach helps track the evolution of the code and makes it easy to understand the purpose of each addition.

The main file, `main.cpp`, contains all the algorithm implementations sequentially. This project serves as both a study log and a reference for commonly used algorithms, suitable for interview preparation or improving algorithmic thinking.
